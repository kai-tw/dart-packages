/// being poisoned by a moved clock, but it cannot retract the ones written
/// before an anchor existed — offline, on a first run, or in the window
/// between a clock change and the next successful sample. Those records win
/// every comparison until real time catches up, and on the far side of a sync
/// they are rejected outright by any peer enforcing a future ceiling.
///
/// Nothing is repaired unless the reading is `TimeConfidence.anchored`.
/// Repairing against a device clock would be the same mistake in the other
/// direction: a device that is merely *behind* would rewrite every correct
/// stamp it owns. The two preconditions this class cannot check for itself
/// are on [plan], which is where records are handed over.
