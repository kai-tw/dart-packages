/// Deletes one statement, replacing it with an empty `;`.
///
/// This asks a question none of the expression-level operators can. Swapping
/// a ternary's branches or a comparison's boundary asks "is this expression
/// pinned?" — it presumes the line runs and something depends on which way it
/// went. Deleting a statement asks the prior question: **does any test assert
/// that this line's effect happened at all?** A guard like
/// `if (mounted) { setState(...) }` contains no ternary, no `??`, and no
/// comparison, so every other operator in this package walks straight past
/// it; delete the `setState(...)` and a suite that never asserted the
/// resulting rebuild stays green.
///
/// Only a statement whose parent is a [Block] is proposed. That is the
/// standard definition of statement deletion, and in this codebase it is very
/// nearly total coverage rather than a compromise: the `lints` ruleset these
/// projects use enforces braces on flow-control bodies, so a statement that
/// runs conditionally is a block child too. A brace-less `if (x) return;`
/// would be missed, and is the one known gap.
///
/// Replacing with `;` rather than cutting the text out keeps the edit a pure
/// replacement — an empty statement is syntactically legal anywhere a
/// statement was, so the mutant always parses, and whether it *compiles* is
/// left to the one thing that can actually answer that. Deleting a `return`
/// from a value-returning function, or a variable declaration something later
/// reads, produces a mutant the compile-safety gate rejects; that costs one
/// gate check and scores nothing, which is the same bargain
/// `NullCoalescingDeletion` already makes deliberately.
///
/// Deleting a statement can also produce an *equivalent* mutant — a trailing
/// bare `return;` in a void function is the common one, since falling off the
/// end does the same thing. Recognising those needs flow analysis this
/// operator does not do, so they surface as survivors for a person to dismiss
/// rather than being filtered out on a guess.
