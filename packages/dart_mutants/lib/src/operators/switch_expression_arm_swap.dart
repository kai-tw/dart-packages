/// Replaces one switch-expression arm's result with an adjacent arm's
/// result, leaving every pattern and guard exactly where it was: `1 => a, 2
/// => b` proposes `1 => b, 2 => b` and, separately, `1 => a, 2 => a` — two
/// independent one-arm mutants per adjacent pair, not one mutant that
/// changes both arms at once. Each is applied and tested on its own, so a
/// test suite has to notice specifically *that* arm returning the wrong
/// value, not merely that the switch as a whole changed somewhere.
///
/// This targets the state -> text/value mapping idiom a switch expression is
/// most often used for (`return switch (status) { Loading() => 'loading...',
/// Done() => 'done', ... }`). A regex mutator has no representation for "the
/// switch expression's arms" at all — `dart_mutant`'s own operator reference
/// lists no switch-expression coverage, and a text-pattern approach for
/// "swap two arrow-separated values inside a switch" would be indistinguishable
/// from an ordinary map-literal `:` or a lambda `=>` without parsing the
/// construct, which is the same problem in different clothes.
///
/// Only adjacent pairs feed each other, not every pairing — an N-arm switch
/// gets 2(N-1) mutants rather than a combinatorial N*(N-1), which is enough
/// to exercise "this arm's result belongs to a different arm" without the
/// mutant count exploding on a long switch. A borrowed result is not
/// guaranteed to compile (the two arms' result types can differ enough that
/// the swap breaks the switch expression's own inferred type); as with every
/// operator in this package, that is the compile-safety gate's job to catch,
/// not this operator's.
