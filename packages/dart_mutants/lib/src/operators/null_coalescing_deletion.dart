/// Deletes one side of a `??`: `a ?? b` proposes both `a` alone and `b`
/// alone, each its own mutant.
///
/// `b` alone tests whether any test actually exercises `a` being null — drop
/// the fallback's *reason to exist* and see if anything notices. `a` alone
/// tests the opposite: whether a test exercises the fallback actually being
/// reached. Both are offered per site because which one compiles depends on
/// nullability this operator does not itself analyze — `a`'s static type is
/// very often nullable exactly because it is the left side of a `??`, so `a`
/// alone frequently fails the surrounding context's non-null requirement and
/// gets discarded by the compile-safety gate. That is expected; proposing it
/// anyway costs nothing but one gate check, and `b` alone is usually the one
/// that survives to actually run.
///
/// This is a blind spot for a regex-based mutator for the same reason the
/// ternary is: `??` is two characters that also appear, unrelated, as `?`
/// (nullable type suffix, conditional expression, named-parameter default)
/// followed independently by whatever comes next. Nothing about matching
/// those two characters as text tells you where the left operand ends.
