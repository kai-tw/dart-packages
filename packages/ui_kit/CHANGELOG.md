## 1.2.0
- `CommonNavTile` (all three named constructors) gains an optional `subtitle`
  param, rendered as the tile's `ListTile.subtitle`.
- `CommonDeleteDialog` (and its `.show` helper) gains optional `confirmPhrase`
  + `confirmFieldHint` params — when set, the delete button stays disabled
  behind a text field that must match `confirmPhrase` exactly, for actions
  that need more friction than a second tap. `confirmFieldHint` is required
  whenever `confirmPhrase` is set (same text-ownership rule as everywhere
  else in this package).

## 1.1.0
- Added `CommonBadge`, `CommonNavTile` (`.none`/`.internal`/`.external`),
  `CommonInfoWidget`/`CommonErrorWidget`(+Sliver+Dialog)/`CommonLoadingWidget`
  (+Sliver+Dialog)/`CommonSuccessDialog`/`CommonProgressDialog`, and
  `CommonDeleteDialog` — merged from equivalent widgets independently built
  in CherishCRM-Flutter and NovelGlide-Flutter (see each class's doc comment
  for which app's shape won and why). New dependency:
  `loading_animation_widget`. No widget in this package ships built-in copy —
  see README §Text ownership.

## 1.0.6
- Moved into `dart-packages` as a workspace member. No longer published to
  pub.dev — consumed as a git dependency. No functional change.

## 1.0.4
- Fix that DateTimePickerField didn't get correct value in onSave if initial value was provided by controller in initState.

## 1.0.2
